# PwaAngular

## Try It

Run the master branch example:

```bash
# git checkout [branch-name]
npm i

# build prod build, generate sw, run the express server out of /dist
npm start
```

Or run it in dev mode:

```bash
npm i

# start the Node express API server in dev, and the angular app, but no SW
npm run start-dev-proxy
```

## Variations

There are various techniques in this repo, contained in different branches. Each accomplishes similar tasks, with variations n the end result. Learn moer below. All contain `manifest.json`, and variations on the service worker and code to use the servie worker.

| branch  | features  |
|---|---|
| sw/online-only  | no PWA qualities |
| sw/workbox/generate  | Generates a service worker with caching, no custom code  |
| sw/manual  | All custom code for caching, sync, and push  |
| sw/workbox/inject-cache-and-extend  | Workbox to cache, custom code for sync and push  |
| master  | same as sw/workbox/inject-cache-and-extend |
| ng  | wip  |

### Online only

- *sw/online-only* branch

The app only runs online. There is no service worker `sw.js` and no `manifest.json`. Push notifications are disabled.

### Workbox Caching by Generating the Entire Service Worker

- *sw/workbox/generate* branch

The generated service worker contains all of the logic that to accomplish:

1. precache of app shell files
1. fallback to `/offline.html` for unknown routes
1. runtime caching of routes (e.g. `/api/data` routes)

#### Precaching

The precache list is generated along with the service worker. The first time the app loads, a list of files retrieved over the network are matched against the list of precache routes. The matches' responses are stored in Application Cache. Subequent page refreshes will check the cache first for a match, if found it will return the reponse.

After responding, another fetch is fired off to check if the response has changed. If the response changed, it will cache the new response for next time.

#### Runtime caching

When a route cannot be found in cache, it is fetched. If the fetch returns a valid response, it is added to the Application Cache. Data calls to the api will be cached with runtime caching

After responding, another fetch is fired off to check if the response has changed. If the response changed, it will cache the new response for next time.

#### Fallback

When a route cannot be found in cache nor via fetch, the app redirects to an offline.html page.

### Manual Service Worker

- *sw/manual* branch

The manual service worker contains a `sw.js` file which contains all of the logic that to accomplish:
1. precache of app shell files
2. fallback to `/offline.html` for unknown routes
3. runtime caching of routes (e.g. `/api/data` routes)
4. background sync
5. push notification subscription

#### Precaching

The precache list is stored in a `manifest.js` file that is generated by *workbox-build* process. The `sw.js` reads the `manifest.js` to get the precache list of files. The first time the app loads, a list of files retrieved over the network are matched against the list of precache routes. The matches' responses are stored in Application Cache. Subequent page refreshes will check the cache first for a match, if found it will return the reponse.

After responding, another fetch is fired off to check if the response has changed. If the response changed, it will cache the new response for next time.

#### Runtime caching

When a route cannot be found in cache, it is fetched. If the fetch returns a valid response, it is added to the Application Cache. Data calls to the api will be cached with runtime caching

After responding, another fetch is fired off to check if the response has changed. If the response changed, it will cache the new response for next time.

#### Fallback

When a route cannot be found in cache nor via fetch, the app redirects to an offline.html page.

#### Background Sync

When the user attempts to send a text message, the app detects if the service worker is available. If the service worker is available, the message is stored in IndexDB and a background sync message is sent to let the service worker know that message is ready. The service worker listens for the sync event and for the specific message tag. It then retrieves the message(s) from IndexDB and sends the text message(s) to the server. If the http post was successful, the messages are removed from IndexDB. If the http post fails, the messages remain in IndexDb.

If service worker is not available, the messages are sent online directly from the app, with no service worker involvement.

When the app is offline, the service worker's sync event does not fire. Once the app goes back online, the sync event fires and all messages found in IndexDB are posted to the server.

#### Push Notification
When the user clicks the "subscribe" button, the service worker will subscribe to a specific push notification from the server using a key. From this point when the server sends a push notification, the service worker will listen for it and show the push notification. Once the user unsubscribes, the push notifications will cease.

### Workbox Caching and Extend with Manual Background Sync and Push

- *sw/workbox/inject-cache-and-extend* branch

The manual service worker contains a `sw.js` file which contains all of the logic that to accomplish:

1. precache of app shell files
1. fallback to `/offline.html` for unknown routes
1. runtime caching of routes (e.g. `/api/data` routes)
1. background sync
1. push notification subscription

#### Precaching

The precache list is generated by *workbox-build* process and injected into the `sw.js` file. The first time the app loads, a list of files retrieved over the network are matched against the list of precache routes. The matches' responses are stored in Application Cache. Subequent page refreshes will check the cache first for a match, if found it will return the reponse.

After responding, another fetch is fired off to check if the response has changed. If the response changed, it will cache the new response for next time.

#### Runtime caching

When a route cannot be found in cache, it is fetched. If the fetch returns a valid response, it is added to the Application Cache. Data calls to the api will be cached with runtime caching

After responding, another fetch is fired off to check if the response has changed. If the response changed, it will cache the new response for next time.
